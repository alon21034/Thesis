\chapter{Introduction}

In the age of information, more and more services are provided through the Internet. It is an important issue about how to verify someone's identity on the web. Therefore, a secure \emph{Authentication System} become very inportant. Password-based scheme is the most common scheme now, however, it is not secure enough. Malicious attackers can get people's password in many different approaches. Since password-based scheme cannot protect us very well, our privacy are exposed to great danger.

\section{Motivation}

Lots of researchers have demonstrate various authenication methods in recent decades. However, some of them are not secure enough, and some of them are with low usability. It is hard to design a solution which is both user-friendly and secure enough.

Therefore, in my research, I try to take the advantage of the mobile device and design a user-friendly authentication solution. 

\section{Contributions}

In my research, I proposed a user-friendly authentication system. In chapter 3, I'll describe this system more detailed, and give a high-level code example to briefly explain about how to implement it. In chapter 4, I build some criteria to estimate the performance of my suthentication system in security, deployment ability and usability. In the last chapter, I compare the existing authentication schemes to my new design. I cannot claim that my scheme is the best one, but I believe that it will be useful in some scenario.
